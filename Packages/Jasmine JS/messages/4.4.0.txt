Hello!

Sorry for the interruption but sublime jasmine just got a mini update.

I wanted to remind you that if you experience any problems it might be because of the workaround this package uses to provide snippets.

Restarting Sublime Text should fix it (and maybe re-running `Toggle quotes`).

If you have any problems (or feature request) please go to: https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-jasmine

That's all, thanks!
