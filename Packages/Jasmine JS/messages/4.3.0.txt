Recent Changes
==============

Hello!

Two improvements!
- The indentation of some snippets has been fixed
- Using the `Toggle quotes` command only changes the necessary snippets, making it much faster

**IMPORTANT**:

If you experience any problems it might be because of the workaround this package uses to provide snippets with both single and double quotes.
Restarting Sublime Text should fix it (and maybe re-running `Toggle quotes`).
